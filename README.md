# TerrariaPatcherPlugins

This is a general repo for all the plugins I'll be writing/releasing. Final versions of the plugins will be posted in the [parent thread](http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/1-3-terrariapatcher-plugins-and-more.24615/) of the application.

You are welcome to use the "bleeding edge" version of the plugins directly from this repo, but you should be aware that they may not function 100% correctly.
